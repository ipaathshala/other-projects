                    <p class="text-justify">The Birla Institute of Technology & Science, BITS Pilani is an all-India Institute for higher education. The primary motive of BITS is to "train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information". The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Over the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and "can-do" entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Offered at the first tier, these degrees have nomenclature like B.E. (Hons.), B.Pharm. (Hons.), M.M.S (Master of Management Studies), M.Sc. (Hons.), M.Sc. (Tech.), and M.A. (Hons.). These are level wise equivalent degrees. They are considered to be integrated degrees for two reasons: (i) the degree program includes several cross disciplinary common coursessuch as basic math and science and, (ii) no intermediate degree, like, B.Sc., B.Sc. (Hons.), B.A., B.A. (Hons), etc. is awarded. These degrees are modular in structure and academic requirements are spelt out in terms of the number of courses studied rather than the number of years. All our programmes are designed in a way to facilitate completion within eight semesters. Our flexible academic policy gives students the option to complete their degree both at a faster pace (finishing it earlier than 8 semesters) as well as at a slower pace to finish it in later than 8 semesters.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">B.E.(Hons.) These programmes in engineering are mathematics and hard science based and incorporate many up-to-date techniques of analysis and synthesis. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">B.Pharm.(Hons.) Our B.Pharm.(Hons.) programme has been structured to match and exceed the requirements of the Pharmacy Council of India. The programme offers students additional courses which give the shape and flavour of engineering as well as fundamental sciences giving an added dimension to the studentâ€™s academics.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">M.Sc.(Hons.)
                      These are integrated degree programmes without any intermediate B.Sc. degree. While these programmes ensure the required science component in any comparable postgraduate science degrees of other universities, they also incorporate many courses which have been notionally considered to be the domain of engineers. The integrated nature of the programmes and their analytical and engineering science contents give them a added professional character and equips students with the skills and problem solving abilities to participate usefully in industrial jobs. While a capable student with a 10+2 background may be able to complete these programmes in four years, students with a 10+2+3 background with a B.Sc. degree, admitted on advanced standing basis will require two to three years to finish the programme. The vast majority of students who are admitted for these degrees also aspire and work for a second degree from B.E. (Hons.), M.M.S., B.Pharm. degrees under the dual degree scheme.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">M.Sc.(Tech.)
                      These programmes are multi-disciplinary, technological in character and are designed to meet the requirements of newly emerging professional activities. While these programmes are also science and technology based, their requirements of mathematics, science, applied science etc. will be different from B.E. (Hons.) and M.Sc. (Hons.). The areas which are currently incorporated in these degree programmes are Engineering Technology, Information Systems, Finance and General Studies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The Engineering Technology programme gives students an exposure across all engineering disciplines and emphasizes knowledge of the operation of various technological units.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The programme on Information Systems equips students with comprehensive skills on computer software and software engineering techniques, both at the conceptual and application levels.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The Finance degree has been designed to meet the manpower needs due to the new thrust given to growth patterns in the economy. The courses planned for this programme meet the skill set requirements of financial institutions as well as financial management needs of any industry. The programme is complementary to the M.Sc.(Hons.) Economics programme and the MMS programme.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The General Studies programme does not have any specific discipline objective. However, the course is charted out in a way that candidates take humanities courses as well as certain general science and technology courses. Students sometimes also seek to acquire specific skills to meet varied career objectives by making planned use of electives and project oriented courses.</p>
