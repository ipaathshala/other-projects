It's going to be a task between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. My 2 year experience here was an adventure. Professors here helped me a lot in teaching, doubts, concepts clarification. I would say they are true experts of their subjects. The professors here are the best! The environment and ambience of the classrooms was far beyond my expectation. Good infrastructure, comfortable benches, quality teaching facilities, you name it! Learning here was fun and the environment maintained by the teachers was cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the information about the mighty class in our 11 Std. I was also given the right guidance about the books to be referred to in addition to the study materials provided. The periodical tests and practice questions given by Paathshala were really challenging, not sub-standard as given by other classes. This motivated me to go deeper into the subject and clear my doubts. The more you practice, the more skilled you become. For NEET aspirants, I would say never leave your doubts. Get them clarified with your professors. Keep a tab with whatever is being taught in class and don't keep any backlog. It is very important to solve as many previous question papers as possible. I would rest my case on a final note that, if Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honours and respect it truly deserves!! &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
