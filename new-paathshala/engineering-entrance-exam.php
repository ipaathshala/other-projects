                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: The JEE Main exam will only be held in the computer based mode. The HRD ministry will organise practice centres from August. These will be free of cost for all aspirants who want to familiarise themselves with the new mode of examination.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: Can the candidates opt for both the papers of JEE Main?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: Yes, the candidates can appear for both papers in JEE, or can also have the liberty to appear for just one of the two.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: Can candidates change the date of their exam?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: Candidates can change the date of their exam only if it clashes with something important, like a board exam.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: Is it compulsory to have an Aadhaar Card Number to apply for JEE Main ?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: Yes, it’s mandatory for candidates to enter their Aadhaar Card Number in the application form in order to register successfully. No application will be accepted without the Aadhaar Card Number.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: A candidate has applied for both Paper 1 and Paper 2. Can he or she opt for just one paper now?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: There is no compulsion for such candidates to appear in both papers. They can choose to appear for the paper of their choice. However, there will be no refund of fees.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: What action is to be taken if the candidate has opted for Hindi or Gujarati medium for the examination but now wants to appear in the English medium?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: The JEE Main question paper is bilingual (both in Hindi and English as well as Gujarati and English) for candidates who have opted for Hindi or Gujarati mediums. The candidate can attempt the questions in any medium during the examination.</p>
                        <p class="text-justtify"><strong>Q: What colleges can I get into through JEE Main?</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justtify">Ans: IITs, NITs, IIITs and a list of 100 or so central or state funded institutions participate in JEE Main. Though IITs and ISM don’t accept the JEE Main score, they require the JEE Advanced score, this is the first step to getting into the best colleges.</p>
