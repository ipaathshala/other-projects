It's going to be a task between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. My 2 year experience here was an adventure. Professors here helped me a lot in teaching, doubts, concepts clarification. I would say they are true experts of their subjects. The professors here are the best! The environment and ambience of the classrooms was far beyond my expectation. Good infrastructure, comfortable benches, quality teaching facilities, you name it! Learning here was fun and the environment maintained by the teachers was cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the information about the mighty class in our 11 Std. I was also given the right guidance about the books to be referred to in addition to the study materials provided. I would rest my case on a final note that, if Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honours and respect it truly deserves!! <i class="fa fa-quote-right margin-left-10px"></i>

In the beginning itself, Professor Sagar Sir had given Nihar a view of the goal and how to reach that goal and how to start.  Taking admission here did wonders for Nihar.   The way of teaching by the faculties was very good as Nihar was very enthusiastic and loved going to Paathshala classes without missing even a single class.

I studied for about 5-6 hours daily. I gave more time to the subject I was weak at. I revised the topics done in the class daily. And this helped me a lot in improving my scores in the exams. I also learnt how to manage my time and how not to make silly mistakes. The professors are knowledgeable and I give them a rating of 10/10.

The one thing I liked here is that they provide great academic support which helped me excel in all the subjects. The professors are experienced and provide us in depth knowledge of the subject.

Whenever you have doubts, get it cleared with the professors. The study materials, the class notes and the assignments given at the class are enough for getting good marks in JEE. I also got to know tips and techniques and time management strategies from the counselor which were very helpful.

All these have contributed towards Devansh succeeding in JEE Advanced. Before the exams, the professors explained to us which topic is to be covered, which topic should be solved and Devansh's success is to be attributed to the fact that he scored minimum negative marks in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced. To the entrance exam aspirants, we would say, there has to be regular study by the student for 2 years.

Every professor has taught me valuable life lessons too. [After my 10th Std, I have joined a different institute but over there, my concepts were not being clarified] Hence, I have joined Paathshala later. My concept clarity strengthened with time. My frequency of solving problems without making silly mistakes has increased. Also, the time taken by me for solving each sum has reduced. This capability has become an integral part of me. I have also learnt a lot about life at Paathshala. I can feel the connection between Maths and Life. 'Integration' taught me that if you keep adding up small efforts, you WILL make it large despite any obstacles of 'what to substitute'. Plus, you will get the added bonus of '+C' in the end.

Here the student gets all the required facilities and study material required for perfect preparation. The classification of the topics into subtopics has helped in better understanding of the concepts in that topic.  Also, the classes are conducted in small batches which enables the professor to give personalized attention to the student. The student is encouraged to ask questions and clear all his doubts. I was initially in a different institute before joining Paathshala. I would have to work much much harder if I were at some other institute, where they start the portion slowly but in the end moments they finish the portion.  That too they don’t teach properly.  They give you a mix bag of theories; you need to go into it and search out the important points.  Here at Paathshala Education, the professors are knowledgeable and provided personalized attention to each student and clear all their doubts on the subject.   They guide you properly and give what is actually required.  For entrance exam aspirants, I would say do not count the number of hours you study instead solve more conceptual questions because this is what that develops our concepts.  As soon as you finish theory, start off with practice papers of previous years and solve them as much as possible. <i class="fa fa-quote-right margin-left-10px"></i>

The professors taught me from the basics of 11th standard and made me capable of solving MCQs of JEE Main level quickly. Also, I was made to solve lots of questions from previous years' tests.  I could understand the questions and what I am supposed to answer.  I would advise the future batches of Paathshala to stay focused on studies, clear your concepts of each topic and solve as many questions as possible. And beware of the marketing strategies used by the coaching classes and don't fall prey to them.

Due to small size of the batch, we got personalized attention from the faculty. Also audio visuals and small videos are shown in the class to make the study more understandable and entertaining. Compared to Paathshala, when I was at another institute before joining Paathshala, their method of teaching was different and I could not understand the concepts well. At Paathshala, the professors ensured that I understood the concepts and its application correctly. Each topic is categorized into divisions for better understanding.  Plus there are lots of practice questions to be solved which help us to gain confidence.

The Academics modules helped me understand the concepts well for my college exams as well. For the future batches in Paathshala and JEE/NEET aspirants, my advice would be, not to panic or stress. One has to only study hard, understand the concepts well and solve maximum number of previous years’ questions. I motivated myself to prepare well for the exams without getting stressed; listening to music in my spare time was a booster.  Some of my school friends used to ask me questions from other institutes' module which I could easily answer. So, by being a student of Paathshala, I had the competitive advantage over students from other institutes. <i class="fa fa-quote-right margin-left-10px"></i>

The Professors clear all our doubts easily, they encourage us to ask questions and are very supportive.  After the JEE Main, some of my friends, mentioned to me they did not do well.  But for me, thanks to Paathshala, I performed much better than the others.  This is because Paathshala conducted various Chapter Wise Tests, later on the Full Syllabus Tests  were given. The level of tests at Paathshala were also higher so that we do not get nervous during the actual exam. The counsellors and professors were co-operative and helped us in time management, suggested what additional books to buy and to how to solve extra papers at home.  For a JEE aspirant, I would suggest, the preparation should start from XI Std itself without taking any stress.  There should be very less use of mobile phone for these two years and the student should be focused only on studies.

Preparation for JEE Exam is a difficult task but the guidance given by the professors here made the things easier. Highly experienced professors of Paathshala have supported and guided us at every step during the preparation. Studying at Paathshala was actually full of fun for me. Paathshala is the right place for entrance exam preparation and my journey at Paathshala has been the most fulfilling one.

                        In the previous institute I studied earlier, I had many conceptual doubts which was a setback in the MCQ performance.  After coming to Paathshala, I got personalized attention from various faculties, and continuous clarification of doubts, helped me solve the questions appropriately.  When the conceptual doubts are cleared, then the question solving ability is developed automatically.  Also you should attempt all the Part Syllabus, Full Syllabus and Topic Wise Tests to get the confidence for scoring high marks in competitive exams. For the future batches at Paathshala, I would say that this is the best institute where personalized attention is given to the student.

The best way to crack the JEE exams is to initially focus on the fundamentals and give each topic a lot of time.  Secondly, towards the later days you should practice 50 full syllabus of Mains tests and 50 full syllabus of Advance tests.

The Academics and Tests module helped me prepare well and improve my scores as I solved as many questions to gain confidence.  For an entrance exam aspirant, I would say you should stay focused on studies and it is important that you should solve lots of practice questions keeping a timer. It is advisable to keep away from all distractions especially social media for these two years.  Use your mobile only when required and do not spend too much time on it. What I appreciate about Paathshala is that they are goal oriented and the smaller batch size enables the Professors to give personalized attention to the student. <i class="fa fa-quote-right margin-left-10px"></i>
